📊 Placement Analytics Project | Built with Looker Studio

As part of my data analytics learning journey, I created a Placement Dashboard using real-world data to extract meaningful insights about MBA student outcomes.

🔧 Here’s how I built it, step by step:

Data Cleaning & Preparation:

Structured raw placement data in Google Sheets

Standardized fields like gender, specialization, salary, and placement status

Data Connection:

Connected Excel to Looker Studio

Set up filters for interactivity and drill-down analysis

Visualization Design:

Used bar charts, pie charts, and tables to show:
▪️ Placement rates
▪️ Salary trends
▪️ Specialization-wise placement comparison

Insight Extraction:

Found that ~69% of students were placed

Marketing & Finance had the highest placement rate

Salary offers ranged up to ₹4,00,000

📌 Tools Used: Looker Studio, Excel 
🎯 Skills Applied: Data cleaning, visualization, dashboard design, storytelling

I’m actively seeking opportunities in Data Analytics / Business Intelligence roles where I can apply and grow these skills further.

📥 Happy to share the full dashboard or PDF if you'd like to explore it!
